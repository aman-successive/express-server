#Client-Server Architecture
---


Client/server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. This system shares computing resources.

Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered over a network.
###Characteristics of a server
* It is initially passive (or slave, waiting for a query)
* It is listening, ready to respond to requests sent by clients
* When a request comes, he treats it and sends response.
###Characteristics of a client
* It is the first active (or master);
* Sends requests to the server;
* It expects and receives responses from the server.
###Benefits Of Client Server
* All data are centralized on a single server, simplifying security checks and updates data and software.
* The technology supporting the client / server are more mature than others.
* A level administration server, customers have little importance in this model, they have less need to be administered
###Disadvantages Of Client Server
* If too many clients to communicate with the server at the same time, it may not carry the load (while peer to peer networks work better by adding new members).
* If the server is no longer available, most customers do not walk (the peer network continues to function even if many participants leave the network).
* The costs of setting up and maintenance are high.
