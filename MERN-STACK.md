#MERN STACK
---
###What is MEAN and MERN stack?
**MEAN** is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:
* **Angular (formerly Angular.js, now also known as Angular 2)**: Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
* **Express (sometimes referred to as Express.js)**: Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
* **Node.js** : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript
* **MongoDB** : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
###ReactJS – Rise of the MERN Stack
An alternative to Angular is **React** (sometimes referred to as ReactJS), a JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive/reactive user interfaces. Like Angular, React breaks the front-end application down into components. Each component can hold its own state and a parent can pass its state down to its child components and those components can pass changes back to the parent through the use of callback functions.
**React** is most commonly executed within the browser but it can also be run on the back-end server within Node.js, or as a mobile app using React Native.
